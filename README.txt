# OpenBLDCServo
### A fully open-sourced brushless servo controller

## Project Goals
### Low Cost 
####	<$20 for fully assembled pcb at minimum quantities
### High Performance
####	Provide quicker response, better holding accuracy than Nema 17 Steppers
### Support direct drop-in replacement for use in 3D printers
####	Include adapter board to plug into typical pololu stepper driver sockets
### Support linear encoder based systems
#### 	Support maximum precision XY stages with true position closed-loop feedback



PCB's are on order, qty10. Assuming there are no major bugs, a number of units may be available for beta testing and co-developers. Contact me via email for more details!
